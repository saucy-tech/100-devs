### Reponsive Web Design

#### What makes a site responsive?

- Fluid
  - Everything as a percentage
- Elastic
  - EMs & REM (root EMs)
  - EMs get their styling from the closest parent
  - REMS get their styling from the root element (html)
  - Make 1 change and everything responds (font size)
- Content Decisions
  - What do you want user to see at this size?
  - Mobile-first is good idea

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
section {
  font-size: 10px;
}
p {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

- Content Decisions
  - At this size, what should they see?
  - Best practice: start mobile first

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    background: blue;
  }
}
```

### **Add to HTML Head**

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```
