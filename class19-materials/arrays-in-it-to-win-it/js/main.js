//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let favMovies = ["The Lord of the Rings", "Star Wars", "The Three Amigos"];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let topFavMovie = favMovies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let movieLength = favMovies.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let leastFavMovie = favMovies[favMovies.length - 1];
