## **Notes**

### The Box Model

- Width, Height, Padding, Border

### Layouts

- Floats
  - they try to go as far to the top corner as possible
  - they "float up 3D" and everything below moves up
  - really need to CLEAR after you use it!
- Clear Floats
  - Use clear property in CSS on element that comes after the float

```css
clear: both;
```

- Box-Sizing: border-box
  - Tells browser to ignore borders when calculating width

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
